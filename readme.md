# Data Visualizations in Public Companies – Costco Case Study

## Description
This project analyzes and critiques real-world corporate visualizations using Costco's 2024 Annual Report and Climate Action Plan. It demonstrates how to improve stakeholder communication through clearer and more effective data visuals.

## Objective
To apply data visualization best practices by evaluating and improving four published corporate visualizations based on clarity, design principles, and communication value. The goal was to make data easier to interpret for a range of stakeholders, including investors, employees, and customers.

## Project Structure
1. **Visualization 1** – 5-Year Cumulative Total Return  
   - Comparative line chart analysis between Costco, S&P 500, and Retail Index  
   - Focused on audience clarity and investment decision support

2. **Visualization 2** – Global Store Locations (Outside North America)  
   - Evaluation of Costco’s international footprint using maps  
   - Suggested title additions and labeling improvements for clarity

3. **Visualization 3** – Average Sales per Warehouse Over 10 Years  
   - Assessed performance tracking and trends in expansion and profitability  
   - Recommended splitting variables for clearer insight and future forecasting

4. **Visualization 4** – Climate Action Progress  
   - Reviewed environmental KPIs in Costco’s sustainability plan  
   - Proposed redesign using sparklines and unified measurement formats

## Key Results
- Identified design flaws such as unclear labeling, mixed data types, and inconsistent terms  
- Suggested actionable visual enhancements (e.g., color-coding, removal of clutter, clearer axis labeling)  
- Reframed visuals for targeted audiences (e.g., shareholders, board members) to improve communication and decision-making

## Learning Outcomes
- Strengthened ability to critique and improve real-world business data visualizations  
- Applied design thinking principles such as storytelling, audience alignment, and visual clarity  
- Gained hands-on experience converting static corporate data into more impactful narratives
